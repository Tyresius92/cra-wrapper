# cra-wrapper

This repo contains a wrapper script around Facebook's Create React App (CRA). The script runs Create React App, then runs code to reformat the project with my preferred defaults. Configuration includes setting up my preferred "**tests**" directory structure, additional scripts in package.json, and adding eslint and prettier config files.

### TODO

Set the script up to be run as a global.
